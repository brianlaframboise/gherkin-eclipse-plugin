This plugin is intended to provide not only syntax highlighting; but also to work well with the cucumber-jvm code.

I am doing this to enjoy using cucumber-jvm more effectively and also with more fun. If you want to leverage off the stuff I am doing; fork the code and send pull requests.
I am unlikely to do anything that I don't want personally for myself as I am a busy man with a family to feed.


I have just started working on it; and have got syntax highlighting working... well words appearing as different colours in English only.. but hey I've just begun.

So it goes...
