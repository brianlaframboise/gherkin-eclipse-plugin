[First stab at syntax highlighting after first commit](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pillemer/7047175079)

##  Installation

### Pretty yucky at the moment.

* Given you have checked out the code.
* And you have createf an empty plugin project in Eclipse.
* And you have imported the folders into that project (overwrite mode)
* And you have exported from Eclipse into a jar file
* And you have dropped the jar file into your plugin directory
* Then you will have the first stab syntax highlighting in .feature files


I will make a jar file available soon of latest build to just drop into the plugin directory. Probably tonight my time.

## Stream of Consciousness

This plugin is intended to provide not only syntax highlighting; but also to work well with the cucumber-jvm code.

I am doing this to enjoy using cucumber-jvm more effectively and also with more fun. If you want to leverage off the stuff I am doing; fork the code and send pull requests.
I am unlikely to do anything that I don't want personally for myself as I am a busy man with a family to feed.


I have just started working on it; and have got syntax highlighting working... well words appearing as different colours in English only.. but hey I've just begun.



So it goes...
